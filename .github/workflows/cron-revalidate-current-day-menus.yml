    # GitHub runs cron jobs on UTC +0 time. We want this job to run every
    # morning. Finland's timezone is +3 in summer and +2 in winter. So this job
    # runs at 7 o'clock in summer and at 6 o'click in winter.
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron: '0 4 * * *'
